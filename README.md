# Hospital-Proyect
Place to upload the development of my project focused on a hospital

# About my project 
In this project I will develop a program for a hospital, where the doctor objects will exist, which will refer to all those doctors who work in the place; the patient object, which will be directly related to the doctor class since one or more patients will be assigned to the hospital doctors and I will also create the medicines or therapies object, which will consist of those activities or medicines that the patients will require to heal.

The reason why I find it interesting to work on this idea is because in a hospital it is very necessary to carry out a great organization between doctors and their patients and also keep a record of the inventory of medications necessary for patients. So, apart from helping me develop my skills as a programmer, it will help me better develop my skills in relating objects and will help me learn how to store those objects inside other objects. Apart from that, I also found this topic of medicine interesting and it will help me learn a little more about it.

# Context 
As I already said, in a hospital is really necesary to keep a good organization between doctors, patients, schedules and medicines, so making a programm like this will help, in a fictional hospital context, to maintain this order and record all the data necessary to maintain a good organization in this fictitious hospital. So mainly, this will be the purpose of my project.
